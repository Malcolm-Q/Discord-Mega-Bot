# New
* More video editing subcommands,
* More Image editing commands,
* Audio manipulation (right now just distortion and reverb),
* Customizable server currency,
* Trivia Game, coin flip, 'monster chase' game,
* Procedurally generated fishing game with turn based 2D emoji UI!
    * Visual lake maps are simply procedurally generated for variation,
    * Lake maps are split into 9 tiles each with their own attributes (what fish are in those tiles, how often they bite),
    * Fishing stats are saved, size weight and price of fish range,
    * Some fish are rarer and more expensive than others,
    * Rarity applies to spawning in a tile and being the fish you hooked,
    * Each user can create their own secret fishing spot.
* More image restoration (old photo sharpening, coloring, and another face restoration),
* max dim checks on image api requests to save time and money,
* command to check the current song the dj is playing,
* command to see similiar songs or artists to a given song or artist (spotify API),
* Check Steam game sales,
* Unsure what game to play? have 3 from your library recommended,
* A few smaller things.

Most of the AI commands are through the replicate or openai API. Running a lot of these solutions locally is too heavy for a lot of consumer machines let alone free/cheap cloud computing machines. Lightweight solutions are ran locally. However [due to the nature of the project,](https://github.com/antimatter15/alpaca.cpp) the **alpaca LLM is also ran locally.** It uses ~4.5gb of ram and takes my CPU to ~30% usage. Keep this in mind if picking a cloud hosting service and you may have to exclude it and use Chatgpt instead. Alpaca is also slower than an API request to chatGPT, on my machine at least, and currently less flexible in terms of personality. A 19 word prompt generated 144 words in one minute and four seconds. Not awful and it's free.

The [**news API**](https://newsapi.org/) is free, [**Replicate API**](https://replicate.com/) is started for free, [**openai API**](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) is pay as you go

# Getting Started
* Once you've cloned the repo you can ****pip install -r requirements.txt****
* If using Alpaca:
    * [Download latest Alpaca release](https://github.com/antimatter15/alpaca.cpp/releases/tag/81bd894) and extract so chat.exe is beside bot.py
    * [Download .bin](https://huggingface.co/Sosaka/Alpaca-native-4bit-ggml/blob/main/ggml-alpaca-7b-q4.bin) and move to same location. (4.2GB)
* Download any fonts you want for video editing and place them in the fonts folder. It uses [Impact](https://www.dafontfree.io/download/impact/) by default and loads Arial if that fails. **fonts must be .ttf**
* Get your [bot token](https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/) from Discord developer portal.
* Get your API keys (linked above).
* Open bot.py and plug keys into the variables at the top of the script.
* There's also many things you can customize (heavily commented, you'll figure it out).

Your directory should look like this:

### **NOTE:**

A lot of the AIs on replicate indicate they are for research purposes only and **'can't be used financially'**. Keep this in mind if you use this bot / strip parts of it and try sell it.

Speaking to the bot in voice chat currently always uses the **microphone on the host machine.** I was unable to find a way for the client to listen to calls so I made that a bandaid fix. That means if you're **running this on a hosting service it won't be able to hear you and if you're running it on your machine it will be listening to your mic** when /talk or /speak_when_spoken_to is called.

(This is an admin only command by default)

Transcribed audio from your mic is sent to ChatGPT (or alpaca if you don't mind waiting) then the response is converted to audio via tts and played.

# Coming Soon
* Update help!
* upgrade [Alpaca](https://github.com/antimatter15/alpaca.cpp) to [LLaMA](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)
* More games / develop fishing game deeper,
* Slash commands / cogs, make code nicer...
* Async API requests,
* Lite version,
* Discover music through dj,
* NLP project of some sort,
* More...

    Codec is h.264 with medium preset and a crf of 23. Discord doesn't support 265 and vp9 and av1 are too slow.

    Extreme speeding of the video can occasionally corrupt audio and may prevent you from doing other tasks. Remove the 
    audio using audio_replace to modify further.
    Discord bots have a max upload of 25mb. If you can not compress it further, ask if an admin can fish it out of the working directory.
